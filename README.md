# Binary-Search-Tree

For this project we were required to build a binary search tree. We had to read-in a text file, separate the words,
then add those words to a binary search tree. Newxt we had to print out the tree inOrder, preOrder, and postOrder.
We then had to find common words that were used in the text file that exceed 3% of the total words. 
Lastly, we had to delete the common words and print out the tree again.
